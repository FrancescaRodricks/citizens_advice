### Attempted Tasks:
* Users need to be able to register with a username, email address and 
password (there is no need to send a confirmation email). 
* Users need to be able to authenticate with their username and password. 
* When a user is successfully authenticated, the API needs to respond with 
a unique user token. 
* User tokens are valid for 1 hour. 
* The API also needs to allow a user token that is up to 2 hours old to be 
exchanged for a fresh user token. 
* Groups have a unique name and can have many users and users can 
belong to many groups. 
* Some users have admin privileges and they need to be able to carry out 
the following actions using a valid user token: 
  * Create groups.

### Not Attempted Tasks:
* Assign users to groups. 
* With a valid user token, other applications need to be able to supply a 
username or email address to request the userâ€™s details (username, email 
address and group memberships).
